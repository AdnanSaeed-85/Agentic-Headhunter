SUMMARY
AI & Machine Learning Engineer dedicated to the next generation of AI moving beyond simple chat to autonomous, tool-using agents. Expert in LangGraph, MCP, and RAG architectures. I combine a strong academic background from the University of Haripur with hands-on experience in building scalable, persistent, and multi-functional AI systems that solve real-world problems.

EXPERIENCE & PROJECTS

AI & Machine Learning Engineer (Internship)
Developers360 | July-2025 – Oct-2025
* Built an AI system that automated B2B lead generation and cut prospecting time by 90%.
* Developed autonomous web agents using LangChain and OpenAI API for real-time data extraction from Google Maps and business websites.
* Implemented intelligent contact-form detection, personalized messaging, and persistent data storage for large-scale outreach tracking.

Multi-Agent Conversational AI with Integrated RAG
* Developed a sophisticated AI conversational agent using LangGraph, LangChain, MCP, HITL (Human-in-the-Loop), and RAG for dynamic, multi-functional interactions.
* Implemented MCP architecture instead of traditional tool calling, integrating specialized MCP servers for RAG-based document querying, real-time stock price retrieval, and expense tracking.
* Utilized async processing, PostgreSQL for persistent conversation threads, and vector embeddings for efficient information retrieval across multiple domains.

RAG-Based Intelligent Query System
* Developed a RAG system for natural language querying and document interaction.
* Implemented semantic search using LangChain, OpenAI Embeddings, and FAISS with optimized chunking strategies for improved retrieval accuracy.
